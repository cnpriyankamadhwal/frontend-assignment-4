## Overview
This assignment is designed to help you practice the **CSS float** property by creating a structured web layout. You will build a **Personal Portfolio Page** that includes key sections about yourself, your courses, and student feedback.

## Task
You are required to create a **Personal Portfolio Page** with the following layout and sections:

1. **Header Section**:
   - Include your name or the page title and a tagline.
   - Style the header to span the full width.

2. **Navigation Menu**:

     - Home
     - About
     - Courses
     - Feedback
     - Contact

3. **Main Content Area**:
   - **About Section**:
     - Add a section with:
       - Your profile photo floated to the left.
       - A brief "About Me" description beside the photo.
   - **Courses Section**:
     - Include a list of courses you have completed (e.g., C++, HTML, CSS).
     - Use a two-column layout to display the courses.
   - **Feedback Section**:
     - Create a section for "Student Feedback" with:
       - Feedback text from three students.
       - Use **CSS float** to place feedback cards side-by-side.

4. **Footer Section**:
   - Divide the footer into two parts:
     - **Left Side**:
       - Add useful links (e.g., Privacy Policy, About, Contact Us).
     - **Right Side**:
       - Add a simple contact form with fields for:
         - Name
         - Email
         - Message
         - A submit button

## Styling
- Use **CSS float** to structure and align content in the layout.
- Ensure the profile photo and "About Me" text are neatly aligned.
- Style the courses section to display items in columns.
- Add hover effects to navigation menu links and footer links.
- Use a visually appealing color scheme for all sections.
